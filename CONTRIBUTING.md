# How to help with this repository.

This repository is for JDND students and mentors going through "Java Basics".

If you find a mistake, find missing instructions, have extra instructions to help students get through a section, or have code you want to share, please follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project). You will make edits and pull requests on README.md, in order to add information there. We hope to collaborate as mentors to help students succeed at the first lessons of JDND.
